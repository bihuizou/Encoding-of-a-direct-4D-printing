Abstract:
Morphing flat sheets into complex 3D shapes is extremely useful for fast manufacturing and saving materials, while it also has volumetrically efficient storage and shipment with a functional usage.  Direct 4D printing is a compelling method to morph complex 3D shapes out of the as-printed 2D plates. However, most direct 4D printing methods require multi-material systems with costly machines. Moreover, most works use an open cell design for a shape shifting by encoding a collection of 1D ribsâ€™ deformation, which cannot remain structurally stable.  Here, we show a direct 4D printing of an isotropic single material system to morph 2D continuous bilayer plates into multimodal 3D complex shapes whose geometry can be locked after deployment.  We develop an inverse design algorithm integrating an extrusion-based 3D printing of a single material system to directly morph a raw printed sheet with into complex 3D geometries such as a doubly-curved surface with a shape locking. Our inverse design tool encodes the localized shape memory anisotropy during the process, providing process conditions for a target 3D morphed geometry. Our method can be used for conventional extrusion-based 3D printing for many applications such as biomedical devices, deployable structures, smart textiles, and pop-up Kirigami structures.

Codes include:
1. Plot the deformed shape of a two-layer plate with given geometrical parameters and activation temperature
2. Generate design maps for various activation temperatures and thickness ratios
3. Inverse design algorithm
4. Reliability analysis (prediction error contours) of the inverse design algorithm
